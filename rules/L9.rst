L9 : interfaces for routines
*****************************

Calls to subroutines and functions that are provided neither by a module nor by a CONTAINS statement, 
must have a matching explicit interface block.

Routines that may be called from outside the IFS should have an interface in the codebase, while 
routines called exclusively internally have their interfaces generated at build time.
