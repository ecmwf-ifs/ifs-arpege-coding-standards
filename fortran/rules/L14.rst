L14 : array declarations in parallel routines
*********************************************

Parallel routines (those processing a list of NPROMA blocks) should wrap their field data 
into Field API objects.

In particular the legacy data representation for model state (PGMV/PGFL arrays) should be 
considered obsolescent and replaced by YDVARS wherever possible.

Parallel routines should never declare an array that will be involved in calculations
(ie passed to NPROMA routines or used in OpenMP sections).
