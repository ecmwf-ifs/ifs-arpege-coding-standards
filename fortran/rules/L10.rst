L10 : preprocessing of interfaces
**********************************

Subroutine signatures shall not require preprocessing to be valid.

Interfaces to routines internal to the IFS/Arpege codebase are auto-generated
by a script which reads 
* ```USE XXX_MOD``` module statements
* argument declarations

These two code sections should be valid fortran without requiring preprocessing.
