L20 : Design of derived types
*****************************

Dervived types should be implemented in modules. Their methods (the minimal code accessing their private attributes) 
should be implemented in the module where they are defined.

The SEQUENCE statement is forbidden in the definition of complex (embedding some POINTER or ALLOCATABLE members) derived types 
meant to be used on accelerators, as the SEQUENCE statement
forbids the implementation of object methods.
