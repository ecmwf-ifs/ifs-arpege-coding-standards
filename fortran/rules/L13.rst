L13 : array declarations in NPROMA routines
*******************************************

NPROMA routines (those processing a single NPROMA block) should only declare arrays of basic 
data types whose kinds are taken from parkind1.F90 and parkind2.F90, eg:

* ``REAL(KIND=JPRB)``
* ``REAL(KIND=JPRD)``
* ``INTEGER(KIND=JPIM)``
* ``LOGICAL``

The leading dimensions of these array should be ``NPROMA``.

Any other arrays are forbidden in NPROMA routines. These other arrays (not depending on 
the meteorological situation) should be computed in the setup and passed as arguments
to NPROMA compute routines, or integrated into sub-components of YDMODEL.

Arrays declared in NPROMA routines be automatic arrays; ALLOCATABLEs and POINTERs are
forbidden.
