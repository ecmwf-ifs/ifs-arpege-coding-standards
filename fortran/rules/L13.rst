L13 : allocatable arrays in NPROMA routines
*******************************************

Arrays declared in NPROMA routines (those processing a single NPROMA block) should be automatic, rather 
than allocatable or pointer-based.

Rationale :

NPROMA routines are typically called a large number of times so efficient handling of memory is
of particular importance in them. Automatic arrays, which are placed on the stack, incur lower 
overheads than allocatable arrays, which are by default placed on the heap.
