Data
====

- Clean working directories before you start a new date cycle

  - Allows time between runs to debug problems or rerun tasks
  - Ensure important outputs are archived

- Avoid accessing off-line data (e.g. MARS and ECFS) in time critical path

  - Store frequently-accessed invariant data on disk
  - Fetch and archive in parallel with the main modelling/processing work

- Back up critical data that is costly to recreate
