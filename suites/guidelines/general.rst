General principles
==================

What is a suite?
----------------
    - a definition of the suite structure including its tasks and their dependencies
    - scripts and software to run these tasks
    - code to generate and deploy the definition and scripts


- Keep it simple
- Use configuration files where possible
- Use version control for suite definitions, scripts and configuration files
- Scripts should should be self-contained without side-effects
- Document tasks in the manual pages enough so operators understand their purpose
