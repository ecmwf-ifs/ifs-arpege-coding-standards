Welcome to the IFS Python standard!
===================================

Developments to the IFS codebase should aim to adhere to the standards
and rules presented in this document.

Standards and rules described here are designed to make code easier to read,
easier to maintain, easier to extend, and less prone to bugs.
The code review process for submissions to IFS should aim to check
code against these standards.
Rules are also written so as to allow implementation of automatic checking.

Guidelines and recommendations
