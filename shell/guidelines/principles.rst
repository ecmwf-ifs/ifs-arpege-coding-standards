Guiding principles
==================

These indicate the high-level direction of what these guidelines are
intended to promote, with the detail of how to achieve this covered in
the subsequent sections.

#. Use the most suitable tool for the job, without excessive variety.
#. Consistency is more important than any particular stylistic choice.
#. Reusable modular components rather than duplication or repetition.
#. Robustness against run-time failures (both standalone and under
   ecFlow).
#. Maximise use of automated check/lint/formatting tools.
#. Avoid either sticking with the past, or adopting the latest thing,
   for the sake of it.
#. Make it *easier* to write and debug scripts that are needed, rather
   than getting in the way of scientific or technical work.
#. Enable a gradual/piecemeal transition of existing scripts rather than
   a "big bang" rewrite of everything at once.
