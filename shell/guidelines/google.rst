Google Shell Style Guide
------------------------

The `Google Shell Style
Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html>`__ provides
an existing well-thought-out set of detailed guidelines for shell
scripting (and there are very few others to be found) that we have
chosen to adopt as a foundation for our purposes. **It is recommended to
follow this guide as a baseline. For conciseness, the details are not
reproduced here but the guide should be read in conjunction with this
document.**

The `ChromiumOS
extensions <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/styleguide/shell.md>`__
to the general Google guidance also offer some useful additions which
should be considered (in particular around shell arithmetic, defaulting
variables, ``printf`` vs ``echo`` and argument parsing with
``getopts``).
